# Project Images Folder

## 📸 Add Your Project Images Here

This folder is for all your construction and remodeling project photos.

### What to Include:
- ✅ Completed project photos
- ✅ Before/after transformations
- ✅ Different service types (framing, roofing, painting, etc.)
- ✅ Interior and exterior shots
- ✅ Detail shots of quality work

### Naming Suggestions:
- `project-001.jpg`, `project-002.jpg`, etc.
- Or be more specific:
  - `kitchen-remodel-after.jpg`
  - `roof-replacement-complete.jpg`
  - `exterior-painting-2024.jpg`
  - `deck-construction-finished.jpg`

### File Types Supported:
- `.jpg` or `.jpeg` (recommended for photos)
- `.png` (if you need transparency)
- `.webp` (modern, smaller file size)

### Tips:
1. **Compress images** before adding (use tinypng.com or squoosh.app)
2. **Reasonable sizes** - Around 1-2MB per image is ideal
3. **Descriptive names** - Makes it easier to manage later
